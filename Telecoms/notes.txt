s: Fast Ethernet

Slot time stays at 512 bits to avoid changes.

Transmission speed increases by an order of magnitute 

Taking into account delays in repeaters, interfaces and time to transmit a jam signal
	reduces the practical length to 250m
		100m from a node to the hub

Protocol is backward compatible and uses the same.
	Wiring system - Star Topology

	Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol

	Frame formats.

100 Base-Tx

Uses Category 5 UTP cabling.

Max Segment length is 100m

Requires 2 twisted pairs per station
One to the hub and one from it.

Half-duplex transmission.
	Collisions are deteted when the transmitting station (or hub) detects a signal on the receive pair when it is transmitting on the transmit pair.

sect: Repeater Hubs

A fast Ethernet repeater has multiple shared ports.
	Ports that are on the same collision domain.

LAN Switching.

A switch makes forwarding decision based on link-layer addresses.
	Decision on layer 2 rather than layer 3
	Avoids the proccessing overhead inherent in routers.

DIV SHOULD HAVE BEEN LISTENING AND NOT PLAYING ANGRY BIRDS.. LAYER 1 NEWB.

Trying to switch things in the optical domain.

Routers are (s)layer 3 devices.

Each frame sent by a device on a LAN carries the link address of the sender in the source address field.

By listening to all frames a switch can quickly determine which devices are connected to which port.

When a device moves or topologis change
	Switch can automatically update its internal tables by this learning device

Reduces the sharing of LAN media.
	By keeping traffic to the segments for which its destined.

sect: Ethernet Switch

An Ethernet switch is a fast multi port device.
	Capable of quickly switching packets on the fly between multiple ethernet collision domains.

An Ethernet switch divides the LAN into many small segments

Instead of sharing the limited capacity(10/100 Mbps) with many computers.
	Each computer or small group of computers can have a dedicated segment connected to a high-capacity Ethernet switch.

sect: Gigabit Ethernet (802.3z)

Need for higher data rates has resulted in the design of Gigabit Ethernet protocol.
	1000 mbps

Gigabit Ethernet has two approaches for media access control.

FIBER.

Half Duplex
	Uses CSMA/CD
	Max Network length is totally dependent on min frame size.
	Three methods defined.
		traditional, carrier extension, frameburst.

Half Duplex Mac

Traditional
	Min frame size is 512 bits
	Slot time = 0.512us
	Max Length = 25m
	May only be suitable to connect machine in a room

Carrier Extension
	To allow for a longer network we increase min frame size
		512 bytes or 4096 bits
	Min frame size is 8 times longer than traditional Ethernet
		Station must pad frames less than 4096 bits
	Max Length of network is 200m
		100m from station to hub.

Half Duplex Mac 2
 
Frame bursting
	Carrier Extension is inefficient if we have a series of short frames to send
	Instead of adding an extension to each frame
		Multiple frames are packaged together and sent
		Padding is added between the frame.
	
Station first sends only one frame with an extension.
	If a collision occurs during the transmission of this frame a jam signal is sent.

If there is no collision the station sends the rest of the frames
	Called a burst frame
	Max length 8192 bytes or 65536 bits.

Full Duplex MAC

Allows for traffic in both directions simulataneously (spelling?).
	Uses a switch to connect computers or other switches.
		Most implementation of Gigabit Ethernet make use of this approach.

FIBER. its in cereal is it not?

MAC protocol does not make use of CSMA/CD
	Collisions cannot take place. (what if u wer driving with your network and u crashed? jus something to think about.)

	Maximum length of cable is now determined solely by signal strength issues.
